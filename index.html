<div id="more-faq" class="collapse">
    
<p><strong>Who is behind HanaHaus?</strong></p>
<p>HanaHaus is the brainchild of Dr. Hasso Plattner, one of the co-founders of global software company SAP SE. Dr. Plattner has been deeply committed to innovation since he and four others struck out on their own to create the company in 1972.  SAP is headquartered in Germany and has offices throughout the world, including a major presence in Palo Alto. It is the world’s leader in enterprise application software and is widely recognized as transforming how companies conduct their business processes and operations.</p>

<p><strong>Why did SAP launch HanaHaus?</strong></p>
<p>The company’s roots lie in innovation, and to be an innovation leader today, SAP believes it must act beyond its own walls. New ideas spring up from anywhere, and creativity lives outside of traditional boundaries. SAP seeks to play a role in fostering a strong sense of community in the technology industry. HanaHaus supports this vision by bringing people together and providing a space where they can connect with each other, explore new ideas and bring these ideas to life. </p>

<p><strong>What are the goals of HanaHaus?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, HanaHaus seeks to bring people together to work, learn and play. </p>
<p>It builds on the legacy of the New Varsity Theater, which was a central hub of activity in Palo Alto dating back to the 1920s. A chief goal is to once again create a centrally located, widely used venue that contributes to the urban vitality of Palo Alto. Every aspect of HanaHaus is designed to encourage community, connection and creativity. Building on the Bay Area’s rich tradition of entrepreneurship and innovation, it aims to spark new thinking that impacts people’s lives by changing their relationship to technology, each other and the world. There is growing recognition that you need cross-pollination of ideas and perspectives to innovate – you can’t work in a silo.</p>

The core of the idea is to connect entrepreneurs and others who are passionate about technology with the experts and services they need to realize their vision. We aim to feature experts and services in a wide range of areas, from user interface design to software architecture. The tech desk reflects the design thinking process and there are likely to be multiple iterations and prototypes tested in coming months.</p>

<p><strong>What is the meaning of the name HanaHaus?</strong></p>
<p>The name is inspired by one of SAP’s greatest innovations, SAP HANA, whose speed and computing power unlock new possibilities for software to play a transformational role in business and people’s lives. ”Haus” calls to mind the modernist Bauhaus movement in Germany that connected functionality and art, similarly to how technology can elegantly impact people’s lives. “Haus” also literally means “house.” HanaHaus aims to build on these meanings to become a home for inspiration and ideas, one that is shaped by the people who use it and becomes a seamless part of the Palo Alto community.</p>

<p><strong>Is HanaHaus a non-profit or for-profit?</strong></p>
<p>HanaHaus is run by SAP, which is a public, for-profit company headquartered in Germany. SAP operates four offices and employs more than 4,000 people in the Bay Area.</p>
