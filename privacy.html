<h3>Not Intended For Use by Children Under 13</h3>
<p>We do not intend for our websites or online services to be used by anyone under the age of 13.

<h3>Anonymous and Aggregate Information</h3>
<p>We combine your information in a way that does not directly identify you. For example, we may combine information about you with information about other people and share the combined information in a way that does not link your information to you.</p>

<h3>Use of Google Analytics</h3>
<p>The Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>
<p>SAP may use this information to evaluate your use of the Website and to make improvements to the Website or Service.</p>
<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. Additionally, you may use the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on developed by Google and available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en. The Add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics.</p>

<h3>California Do Not Track Disclosure</h3>
<p>A Do Not Track (DNT) signal sends information from a browser to a website about a user’s tracking preference. This website does not currently respond to DNT signals, but you can setyour browser to refuse cookies. Please note that if you do so, some functionality of this website may not be available. This website does not allow third parties to gather information about you over time and across websites.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>While using the Services, you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. When information is collected on behalf of SAP exclusively, the appropriate SAP entity's privacy statement will be referenced on the site and will govern how information is used. Other, non-SAP sites, may have their own privacy statements and personal data collection, use, and disclosure practices. For instance, our room reservation system uses a third party payment gateway and merchant to process credit card payments.</p>
<p>We strongly advise you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these other non-SAP sites prior to providing them with any information. SAP is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites outside the SAP Group of companies, which may differ from this Privacy Statement.</p>
